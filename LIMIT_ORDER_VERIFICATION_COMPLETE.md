# ✅ LIMIT ORDER VERIFICATION COMPLETE

## 🎉 **Your Limit Order Just Executed Successfully!**

### **What Happened:**
- **Your Order**: $100 BUY limit at $0.0039
- **Current Price**: $0.003886 (dropped below your limit)
- **Result**: ✅ **Order executed!** You received **25,733.06 TIKI**

---

## 🔍 **Why It Didn't Execute Automatically Before:**

The limit order matching system needs to run periodically to check for orders that should execute. Here's how it works:

### **The Process:**
1. ✅ You create a limit order → Order stored as "PENDING"
2. ✅ Price changes to meet your condition → Order ready to execute
3. ⚠️ **Manual step needed**: Order matching system must run
4. ✅ System executes order → Updates balances, marks as "FILLED"

---

## 🚀 **How to Make It Work Automatically:**

### **Option 1: Manual Execution (What we just did)**
```bash
node scripts/match-limit-orders.js
```

### **Option 2: Use the New "Check Orders" Button**
1. Go to `/user/trade` in your browser
2. Look at your "Open Orders" section
3. Click the **"🔄 Check Orders"** button
4. This will run the order matching system

### **Option 3: Set Up Automatic Execution (Recommended for Production)**

#### **For Development:**
Add this to your `package.json` scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "match-orders": "node scripts/match-limit-orders.js"
  }
}
```

Then run: `npm run match-orders`

#### **For Production:**
Set up a cron job to run every few minutes:
```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * cd /path/to/token-website && node scripts/match-limit-orders.js
```

### **SELL Limit Orders:**
- **Condition**: Current Price ≥ Your Limit Price  
- **Example**: You set $0.0040, current price rises to $0.0041
- **Result**: ✅ Order executes automatically
