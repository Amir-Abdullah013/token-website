## üß™ PHASE 2: MULTI-USER SIMULATION RESULTS

### üë• **Test Users Created**
- Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Eve
- Each with $10,000 USD balance
- Sequential buy/sell operations performed

### üìà **Transaction Results**

| Transaction | User | Action | Amount | Result | Price Change |
|-------------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | Alice | BUY | $500 | 141,428.57 TIKI | 0.00% |
| 2 | Bob | BUY | $1000 | 282,857.14 TIKI | 0.00% |
| 3 | Charlie | BUY | $750 | 212,142.86 TIKI | 0.00% |
| 4 | Alice | SELL | 10,000 TIKI | $34.65 USD | -1.50% |
| 5 | Diana | BUY | $2000 | 574,329.22 TIKI | 0.00% |
| 6 | Bob | SELL | 5,000 TIKI | $17.07 USD | -0.76% |

| 8 | Charlie | SELL | 15,000 TIKI | $50.81 USD | -2.30% |

### üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

#### 1. **SUPPLY INCONSISTENCY**
**Problem**: After sell operations, total supply exceeds initial supply
```
Initial Total Supply: 10,000,000
Final Calculated Total: 10,030,000 (+30,000 tokens)
```

**Root Cause**: Sell operations add tokens back to user supply but don't adjust total supply

#### 2. **PRICE STAGNATION**
**Problem**: Buy operations don't increase price as expected
- All buy operations showed 0.00% price change
- Price remained at $0.0035 despite significant token purchases

**Root Cause**: Supply-based calculation not working correctly for buy operations

#### 3. **NEGATIVE SUPPLY USAGE**
**Problem**: Supply usage shows negative values
```
Final State:
- Supply Used: -30,000 TIKI
- Usage Percentage: -1.5%
- User Supply Remaining: 2,030,000 (exceeds initial 2,000,000)
```

---

- `/api/tiki/price`: ‚úÖ Responding correctly
- `/api/token-value`: ‚úÖ Data consistent
- `/api/price-chart`: ‚úÖ Generating data
- `/api/wallet/balance`: ‚úÖ User data accurate

### ‚úÖ **REAL-TIME UPDATES**
- Price API reflects changes immediately
- Frontend data flow consistent
- No stale values detected
- Rapid updates handled properly

### üìä **Frontend Data Consistency**
```
Data Consistency Check:
- Price Consistent: ‚úÖ
- Supply Consistent: ‚úÖ
- Overall Consistent: ‚úÖ ALL CONSISTENT
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FRONTEND WORKING CORRECTLY**

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED

### üö® **FIX 1: SUPPLY MANAGEMENT LOGIC**

**Problem**: Sell operations create supply inconsistencies

**Current Logic (INCORRECT)**:
```javascript
// In sell operation
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" + $1,
      "remainingSupply" = "remainingSupply" + $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
`, [tokenAmount]);
```

**Corrected Logic**:
```javascript
// In sell operation - DON'T increase total supply
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" + $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
  WHERE id = $2
`, [tokenAmount, tokenSupplyId]);
```

### üö® **FIX 2: BUY OPERATION SUPPLY DEDUCTION**

**Problem**: Buy operations don't decrease user supply

**Current Logic (INCORRECT)**:
```javascript
// Buy operation doesn't properly deduct from user supply
```

**Corrected Logic**:
```javascript
// In buy operation
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" - $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
  WHERE id = $2
`, [tokensToBuy, tokenSupplyId]);
```

### üö® **FIX 3: PRICE CALCULATION FORMULA**

**Problem**: Price calculation not working for buy operations

**Current Issue**: The formula `price = baseValue * (1 + usageRatio * growthFactor)` doesn't work when `userSupplyRemaining` exceeds `totalUserSupply`

**Solution**: Fix the supply calculation logic to ensure `userSupplyRemaining` never exceeds `totalUserSupply`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION FIXES

### 1. **Fix Sell Operation** (`src/app/api/tiki/sell/route.js`)

```javascript
// REPLACE THIS:
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" + $1,
      "remainingSupply" = "remainingSupply" + $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
`, [tokenAmount]);

// WITH THIS:
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" + $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
  WHERE id = $2
`, [tokenAmount, tokenSupply.id]);
```

### 2. **Fix Buy Operation** (`src/app/api/tiki/buy/route.js`)

```javascript
// ADD THIS after successful transaction:
await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE token_supply 
  SET "userSupplyRemaining" = "userSupplyRemaining" - $1,
      "updatedAt" = NOW()
  WHERE id = $2
`, [tokensToBuy, tokenSupply.id]);
```

### 3. **Fix Price Calculation** (`src/lib/database.js`)

```javascript
// In getCurrentTokenValue(), ADD validation:
const userSupplyRemaining = Number(tokenSupply.userSupplyRemaining);
const totalUserSupply = 2000000; // Fixed value

// Ensure userSupplyRemaining never exceeds totalUserSupply
const effectiveUserSupply = Math.min(userSupplyRemaining, totalUserSupply);
const supplyUsed = totalUserSupply - effectiveUserSupply;
const usageRatio = supplyUsed / totalUserSupply;
```
