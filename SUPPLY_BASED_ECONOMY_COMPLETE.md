# 🎉 Supply-Based Token Economy - COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully refactored the entire token economy from dual-inflation (supply + buy-volume) to a **pure supply-based controlled economy**.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
- ✅ Added `userSupplyRemaining` field to `token_supply` (2M tokens - 20%)
- ✅ Added `adminReserve` field to `token_supply` (8M tokens - 80%)
- ✅ Created `admin_supply_transfers` table for tracking admin token releases
- ✅ Added relation to `User` model for supply transfer history
- ✅ Successfully migrated existing database (split: 2,000,012 user / 8,000,046 admin)

**Location:** `prisma/schema.prisma`, `scripts/migrate-supply-split.js`

---

### 2. **Token Value Calculation - Supply-Based Only**
**Formula:** `tokenValue = baseValue * (totalUserSupply / userSupplyRemaining)`

**Before (Dual Inflation):**
- Primary: `tokenValue = baseValue * (totalSupply / remainingSupply)`
- Secondary: `price = totalInvestment / totalTokens` (buy-based)

**After (Supply-Based Only):**
- **Only:** `tokenValue = baseValue * (2000000 / userSupplyRemaining)`
- Inflation increases as user supply is consumed
- No dependency on buy/sell volume

**Location:** `src/lib/database.js` → `tokenValue.getCurrentTokenValue()`

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  baseValue: 0.0035,
  currentTokenValue: 0.0035,  // Calculated value
  inflationFactor: 1.0000,    // 2M / 2M = 1.0 initially
  totalSupply: 10000058,
  userSupplyRemaining: 2000012,
  adminReserve: 8000046,
  totalUserSupply: 2000000,
  usagePercentage: 0.00       // % of user supply consumed
}
```

---

### 3. **Buy-Based Inflation - REMOVED**
✅ **Disabled** `tokenStats.updateTokenStats(investmentChange)`
- Function now returns deprecated flag
- No longer updates token price based on investment
- Returns supply-based value instead

**Location:** `src/lib/database.js` → `tokenStats` (marked as DEPRECATED)

---

### 4. **API Routes Updated**

#### **`/api/tiki/buy`**
- ✅ Removed buy-volume price inflation
- ✅ Uses supply-based `getCurrentTokenValue()` only
- ✅ Checks `userSupplyRemaining` before purchase
- ✅ Deducts tokens from `userSupplyRemaining` after successful buy
- ✅ Returns error if user supply insufficient

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Updated price based on investment
await updateTokenStats(usdAmount);

// After: Check supply + deduct from user supply
if (userSupplyRemaining < tokensToBuy) {
  return error('User supply limit reached');
}
await pool.query(`UPDATE token_supply SET "userSupplyRemaining" = ...`);
```

#### **`/api/tiki/sell`**
- ✅ Removed sell-volume price deflation
- ✅ Uses supply-based pricing
- ✅ Returns tokens to `userSupplyRemaining` after sell
- ✅ Price calculated from supply, not transactions

#### **`/api/stake/[id]/claim`**
- ✅ Changed from `remainingSupply` to `userSupplyRemaining`
- ✅ Checks user supply before distributing staking rewards
- ✅ Deducts rewards + referral bonus from `userSupplyRemaining`
- ✅ Returns detailed error if insufficient supply

#### **`/api/cron/process-stakings`**
- ✅ Changed from `remainingSupply` to `userSupplyRemaining`
- ✅ Auto-processes expired stakings using user supply
- ✅ Logs warnings if user supply depleted

#### **`/api/token-value`** (Frontend API)
- ✅ Returns new supply fields:
  - `userSupplyRemaining`
  - `adminReserve`
  - `totalUserSupply`
  - `usagePercentage`
- ✅ Added deprecation note for buy-based inflation

#### **`/api/admin/supply/update`** (NEW)
- ✅ **POST**: Admin transfers tokens from reserve to user supply
- ✅ **GET**: View transfer history and stats
- ✅ Creates `admin_supply_transfers` record for each transfer
- ✅ Logs admin action in `admin_logs`
- ✅ Returns updated supply status and token value

**Usage:**
```bash
POST /api/admin/supply/update
{
  "adminId": "admin-uuid",
  "amount": 100000,
  "reason": "Allocating tokens for Q1 staking rewards"
}
```

---

### 5. **Frontend Updates**

#### **`src/lib/tiki-context.js`**
- ✅ Removed buy-based price increases in `buyTiki()` fallback
- ✅ Removed sell-based price decreases in `sellTiki()` fallback
- ✅ Price now fetched from server (supply-based) only
- ✅ Added console warnings for deprecated logic

**Before:**
```javascript
const priceIncrease = usdAmount / 1000000;
setTikiPrice(Math.min(1, tikiPrice + priceIncrease));
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Price is controlled by supply-based calculation, not buy volume
console.warn('⚠️ Using fallback. Price not updated (supply-based economy).');
```

---

### 6. **Admin Supply Transfer System**

#### **Database Helper Functions**
Location: `src/lib/database.js` → `adminSupplyTransfer`

**Functions:**
1. `transferToUserSupply(adminId, amount, reason)`
   - Transfers tokens from admin reserve to user supply
   - Creates transfer record
   - Logs admin action
   - Returns updated supply

2. `getTransferHistory(adminId, limit)`
   - Retrieves transfer history
   - Filters by admin if specified

3. `getTransferStats()`
   - Total transfers count
   - Total transferred amount
   - First/last transfer dates

**Security:**
- Only users with `role = 'ADMIN'` can transfer
- All transfers logged with reason
- Transaction-based (rollback on error)

---

### 7. **Supply Limit Enforcement**

#### **User Operations Limited by `userSupplyRemaining`**
All user-facing operations now check user supply:

✅ **Token Buying**
```javascript
if (userSupplyRemaining < tokensToBuy) {
  return { error: 'User supply limit reached. Admin needs to unlock.' };
}
```

✅ **Staking Rewards**
```javascript
if (userSupplyRemaining < (rewardAmount + referralBonus)) {
  return { error: 'Insufficient user supply for rewards' };
}
```

✅ **Referral Bonuses**
- Included in staking reward check
- Deducted from same user supply pool

#### **Admin Reserve**
- 80% of total supply (8M tokens)
- **Locked by default**
- Can only be released via `/api/admin/supply/update`
- Not directly accessible to users

---

## 📊 Token Economy Formulas

### Current Token Value
```
inflationFactor = totalUserSupply / userSupplyRemaining
                = 2,000,000 / userSupplyRemaining

currentTokenValue = baseValue × inflationFactor
                  = $0.0035 × inflationFactor
```

### Example Scenarios

| User Supply Remaining | Inflation Factor | Token Value |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 2,000,000 TIKI        | 1.0000x          | $0.0035     |
| 1,500,000 TIKI        | 1.3333x          | $0.0047     |
| 1,000,000 TIKI        | 2.0000x          | $0.0070     |
| 500,000 TIKI          | 4.0000x          | $0.0140     |
| 100,000 TIKI          | 20.0000x         | $0.0700     |

**Result:** Token value increases as user supply is consumed.

## 🔒 Security & Control

### Admin Controls
1. **Supply Management**
   - Transfer tokens from reserve to user supply
   - View transfer history
   - Monitor supply usage

2. **Token Value**
   - Adjust base value (admin settings)
   - Monitor inflation factor
   - Track supply depletion

### User Limitations
1. **Cannot access admin reserve directly**
2. **All operations limited by user supply**
3. **System prevents operations if supply depleted**

---

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Admin UI** - Create frontend page for supply management
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - Track supply usage over time
3. **Automated Alerts** - Notify admin when user supply low
4. **Supply Forecasting** - Predict when admin needs to unlock tokens
5. **Multi-tier Reserve** - Split admin reserve into multiple pools

---

## ✨ Summary

### What Changed
- ❌ **Removed:** Buy-based inflation (price = investment / tokens)
- ✅ **Added:** Pure supply-based economy (price = baseValue × supply factor)
- ✅ **Added:** Admin-controlled token release system
- ✅ **Added:** User supply limits enforcement

### Why It's Better
1. **Predictable Inflation** - Only dependent on supply usage
2. **Controlled Growth** - Admin decides when to release tokens
3. **Transparent Value** - Clear formula visible to all users
4. **Supply Scarcity** - Limited user supply creates natural value increase
5. **Admin Oversight** - Full control over token distribution

### Current Status
```
✅ Schema migrated
✅ Database updated
✅ All APIs refactored
✅ Frontend updated
✅ Tests passing
✅ Production-ready
```
