## Usage Examples

### Creating a Notification (Admin)
```javascript
import { notificationHelpers } from '@/lib/appwrite';

// Create global notification
await notificationHelpers.createNotification(
  'System Maintenance',
  'The system will be under maintenance from 2-4 AM',
  'warning'
);

// Create user-specific notification
await notificationHelpers.createNotification(
  'Welcome!',
  'Welcome to our platform!',
  'success',
  'user-id-here'
);
```

### Getting User Notifications
```javascript
import { notificationHelpers } from '@/lib/appwrite';

// Get user notifications
const notifications = await notificationHelpers.getUserNotifications(userId);

// Get unread count
const unreadCount = await notificationHelpers.getUnreadCount(userId);
```

### Marking as Read
```javascript
// Mark single notification as read
await notificationHelpers.markAsRead(notificationId);

// Mark all notifications as read
await notificationHelpers.markAllAsRead(userId);
```

## Notification Types
