# Dynamic Fee System Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Overview

The TIKI Token platform now implements a **dynamic fee system** with different rates per transaction type:

- **Transfer**: 5% fee
- **Withdraw**: 10% fee  
- **Buy**: 1% fee
- **Sell**: 1% fee

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Centralized Fee Logic (`src/lib/fees.js`)

```javascript
export async function calculateFee(amount, type = "transfer") {
  const feeRates = {
    transfer: 0.05,  // 5%
    withdraw: 0.10,  // 10%
    buy: 0.01,       // 1%
    sell: 0.01,      // 1%
  };

  const rate = feeRates[type] ?? 0.05;
  const fee = amount * rate;
  const net = amount - fee;

  return {
    feeRate: rate,
    fee: parseFloat(fee.toFixed(6)),
    net: parseFloat(net.toFixed(6)),
    // ... additional fields
  };
}
```

### Database Schema Updates

The `Transaction` model now includes fee-related fields:

```prisma
model Transaction {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Transaction fee fields
  feeAmount        Float   @default(0)     // Fee amount charged
  feeReceiverId    String? @default("ADMIN_WALLET") // Who receives the fee
  transactionType  String?                 // Additional transaction type info
  netAmount        Float   @default(0)     // Amount after fees (amount - feeAmount)
  
  // ... rest of model
}
```

## 🔧 API Route Updates

### 1. Transfer API (`src/app/api/transfer/route.js`)

**Fee Rate**: 5%
**Implementation**:
- Calculates 5% fee on transfer amount
- Deducts full amount + fee from sender
- Credits net amount to recipient
- Credits fee to admin wallet

```javascript
// Calculate transfer fee (5% for transfers)
const { fee, net } = await calculateFee(numericAmount, "transfer");

// Check sufficient balance (user needs to have the full amount + fee)
const totalRequired = numericAmount + fee;
if (senderWallet.tikiBalance < totalRequired) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    success: false,
    error: `Insufficient TIKI balance. Required: ${totalRequired.toFixed(2)} TIKI (${numericAmount.toFixed(2)} + ${fee.toFixed(2)} fee)`
  }, { status: 400 });
}
```

### 2. Withdraw API (`src/app/api/withdraw/route.js`)

**Fee Rate**: 10%
**Implementation**:
- Calculates 10% fee on withdrawal amount
- Deducts full amount + fee from user balance
- Credits fee to admin wallet immediately
- Records transaction with fee information

```javascript
// Calculate withdrawal fee (10% for withdrawals)
const { fee, net } = await calculateFee(amount, "withdraw");

// Check sufficient balance (user needs to have the full amount + fee)
const totalRequired = amount + fee;
if (totalRequired > userWallet.balance) {
  return handleValidationError(`Insufficient balance. Required: $${totalRequired.toFixed(2)} ($${amount.toFixed(2)} + $${fee.toFixed(2)} fee)`);
}
```

### 3. Buy API (`src/app/api/tiki/buy/route.js`)

**Fee Rate**: 1%
**Implementation**:
- Calculates 1% fee on buy amount
- User receives tokens based on net amount (after fee)
- Credits fee to admin wallet
- Records transaction with fee information

```javascript
// Calculate buy fee (1% for buy transactions)
const { fee, net } = await calculateFee(usdAmount, "buy");

// Calculate tokens to buy (based on net amount after fee)
const tokensToBuy = net / currentPrice;
```

### 4. Sell API (`src/app/api/tiki/sell/route.js`)

**Fee Rate**: 1%
**Implementation**:
- Calculates 1% fee on sell amount
- User receives net amount (after fee)
- Credits fee to admin wallet
- Records transaction with fee information

```javascript
// Calculate sell fee (1% for sell transactions)
const { fee, net } = await calculateFee(grossUsdAmount, "sell");

// User receives net amount after fee
const usdToReceive = net;
```

## 💰 Fee Collection System

### Admin Wallet Integration

All fees are automatically credited to the admin wallet using the `creditFeeToAdmin` function:

```javascript
// Credit fee to admin wallet
if (fee > 0) {
  await creditFeeToAdmin(databaseHelpers.pool, fee);
  console.log('💰 Fee credited to admin wallet:', fee);
}
```

### Database Transaction Logging

Each transaction now includes comprehensive fee information:

```javascript
await databaseHelpers.transaction.createTransaction({
  userId: userId,
  type: 'BUY',
  amount: usdAmount,
  currency: 'USD',
  status: 'COMPLETED',
  gateway: 'TikiMarket',
  description: `Bought ${tokensToBuy.toFixed(2)} TIKI at ${currentPrice} USD`,
  feeAmount: fee,
  netAmount: net,
  feeReceiverId: 'ADMIN_WALLET',
  transactionType: 'buy'
});
```

## 📊 Logging & Monitoring

### Console Logging

Each transaction type includes detailed logging:

```javascript
console.log(`💸 ${type.toUpperCase()} | Amount: $${amount}, Fee: $${fee.toFixed(2)}, Net: $${net.toFixed(2)} (${(rate * 100).toFixed(1)}%)`);
```

### Fee Statistics

The system tracks:
- Total fees collected per transaction type
- Average fee amounts
- Fee collection history
- Admin wallet balance updates

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
node scripts/test-dynamic-fee-system.js
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- ✅ Transfer fees: 5%
- ✅ Withdraw fees: 10%
- ✅ Buy fees: 1%
- ✅ Sell fees: 1%
- ✅ Edge cases (small/large amounts)
- ✅ Invalid transaction types (defaults to 5%)
- ✅ Fee validation and calculations

## 🔧 Admin Configuration

### Fee Settings

Admins can configure fee settings through the admin panel:

- **Transaction Fee Rate**: Global fee rate (overridden by type-specific rates)
- **Fee Receiver ID**: Admin wallet ID for fee collection
- **System Active**: Enable/disable fee system

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/fee-config` - Get current fee configuration
- `POST /api/admin/fee-config` - Update fee configuration
- `GET /api/admin/fee-stats` - Get fee statistics and analytics

## 📈 Business Impact

### Revenue Generation

The dynamic fee system provides:
- **Transfer Revenue**: 5% of all transfer amounts
- **Withdrawal Revenue**: 10% of all withdrawal amounts
- **Trading Revenue**: 1% of all buy/sell amounts

### User Experience

- **Transparent Fees**: All fees are clearly displayed to users
- **Predictable Costs**: Users know exactly what fees to expect
- **Fair Pricing**: Lower fees for trading (1%) vs transfers (5%) and withdrawals (10%)
