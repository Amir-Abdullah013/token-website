# ✅ Transactions Page - USD Display & Status Update Fix

## Overview
Fixed the user transactions page to display amounts in **USD ($)** instead of PKR (₨) and ensured transaction statuses are properly updated when admin approves/rejects deposits and withdrawals.

---

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Currency Display Issue**
**Problem:** Transaction amounts were displayed in PKR (₨) instead of USD ($)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/user/transactions/page.js` (Line 101)

**Changes:**
```javascript
// Before
const formatAmount = (amount, currency = 'PKR') => {
  const symbol = currency === 'PKR' ? '₨' : currency === 'USD' ? '$' : currency;
  // ...
}

// After
const formatAmount = (amount, currency = 'USD') => {
  const symbol = currency === 'USD' ? '$' : currency === 'PKR' ? '₨' : currency;
  // ...
}
```

### 2. **API Using Mock Data**
**Problem:** The `/api/transactions` endpoint was returning mock data instead of real database transactions

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/transactions/route.js`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed all mock data
- ✅ Implemented real database queries using `databaseHelpers.pool.query()`
- ✅ Added proper filtering by transaction type (deposit, withdraw, buy, sell)
- ✅ Added proper filtering by status (completed, pending, failed)
- ✅ Implemented pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
- ✅ Added total count query for pagination
- ✅ All amounts returned with `currency: 'USD'`

**Query Structure:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  "userId",
  type,
  amount,
  status,
  gateway,
  description,
  "createdAt"
FROM transactions 
WHERE "userId" = $1
  AND LOWER(type) = $2  -- Optional filter
ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
LIMIT $3 OFFSET $4
```

---

### 3. **Transaction Status Not Updating**
**Problem:** When admin approved/rejected deposits and withdrawals, the transaction records remained in PENDING status

**Root Cause:** 
- The `deposit_requests` table doesn't have a `transactionId` foreign key
- When deposits are created, a separate transaction record is made
- The approval logic was trying to call `updateTransactionStatus(depositRequest.transactionId, ...)` but `transactionId` didn't exist

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/admin/deposits/[id]/route.js` (Lines 99-122)

**Solution:**
Implemented smart transaction matching logic that finds the corresponding transaction by:
- UserId
- Transaction type (DEPOSIT)
- Amount
- Status (PENDING)
- Created date (within ±1 day)

**New Code:**
```javascript
// Find and update the corresponding transaction
const transactionResult = await databaseHelpers.pool.query(`
  UPDATE transactions
  SET status = $1, "updatedAt" = NOW()
  WHERE "userId" = $2 
    AND type = 'DEPOSIT'
    AND amount = $3
    AND status = 'PENDING'
    AND "createdAt" >= $4 - INTERVAL '1 day'
    AND "createdAt" <= $4 + INTERVAL '1 day'
  RETURNING id
`, [newStatus, depositRequest.userId, depositRequest.amount, depositRequest.createdAt]);
```

---

### 4. **SQL Query Error in Count Query**
**Problem:** The count query was including `ORDER BY` clause, causing a GROUP BY error

**Error:**
```
error: column "transactions.createdAt" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/transactions/route.js` (Lines 53-59)

**Fix:**
Moved the count query execution BEFORE adding the `ORDER BY` clause:

```javascript
// Get total count BEFORE adding ORDER BY
const countQuery = query.replace(/SELECT.*FROM/s, 'SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM');
const countResult = await databaseHelpers.pool.query(countQuery, params);
totalCount = parseInt(countResult.rows[0]?.total || 0);

// Order by most recent first
query += ` ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC`;
```

### 5. **Transaction Type Display Enhancement**
**Problem:** Need to handle various transaction type formats (WITHDRAWAL vs withdraw, etc.)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/user/transactions/page.js` (Lines 49-98)

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Added normalization: `const normalizedType = type.toLowerCase();`
- ✅ Added support for WITHDRAWAL → withdraw display
- ✅ Added TRANSFER transaction type with icon 🔄
- ✅ Added PURCHASE as alias for BUY
- ✅ Improved color coding for each transaction type

## 📊 Transaction Type Styling

| Type | Icon | Color |
|------|------|-------|
| Deposit | 💰 | Green (Emerald) |
| Withdraw | 💸 | Red (Rose) |
| Buy | 📈 | Cyan (Blue) |
| Sell | 📉 | Violet (Purple) |
| Transfer | 🔄 | Amber (Yellow) |
