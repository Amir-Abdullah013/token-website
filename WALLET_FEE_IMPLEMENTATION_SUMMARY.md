## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test 1: User creation
# - Sign up new user
# - Verify walletFeeDueAt is set

# Test 2: Referral flow
# - User A signs up
# - User B signs up with A's referral
# - User B stakes $20
# - Verify A's fee is waived

# Test 3: Fee charge
# - User with balance > $2
# - Set walletFeeDueAt to past
# - Call /api/wallet/process-fee
# - Verify fee charged

# Test 4: Wallet lock
# - User with balance < $2
# - Set walletFeeDueAt to past
# - Call /api/wallet/process-fee
# - Verify wallet locked
# - Try to buy/sell → blocked
```

-- Fees collected today
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(amount) FROM transactions 
WHERE type = 'WALLET_FEE' 
  AND "createdAt" >= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Locked wallets
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users 
WHERE "walletFeeLocked" = true;

-- Waiver rate
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "walletFeeWaived") * 100.0 / COUNT(*) 
FROM users 
WHERE "walletFeeProcessed" = true;
```
